An R script is used to produce a dashboard image at regular interval, so this project lets you load a folder with images with chronological filenames (i.e. `2020-01-02.jpg`) and then be able to pick which one you want from a dropdown on a simple webpage. 

## Development environment

- install ruby
- `bundle install`
- To run a test server: `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""`
